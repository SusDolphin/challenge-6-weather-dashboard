# Weather Dashboard

## Description
Weather Dashboard is a sleek, user-friendly website that provides an intuitive weather dashboard. Upon landing, users are greeted with a vibrant, interactive interface that showcases real-time weather updates for their chosen location. The motivation behind this creation was to create accessible and reliable weather information. Many websites tend to present unnecessary data, Weather Dashboard gets straight to the point! We learned how to format our website and pull the necessary API keys to pull this information so that it will display on Weather Dashboard!
